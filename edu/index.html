			<h2>The fee</h2> 
			I don't know as the problem is, they cannot see what they get as they would have to pay in advance.
			All risks on their side.
			Hence maybe 50 EUR per term 4 inscription?
			
			Maybe you can ask 10 students on your side and I 10 here.
			
			Your comment is welcome in the view of improving the concept.
