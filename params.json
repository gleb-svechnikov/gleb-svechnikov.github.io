Graduated public school in 2004, entered [Moscow Technological University (MIREA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Technological_University_(MIREA)) in 2008 I moved to Como(Italy) for my double degree study program at [PoliMi](http://www.polimi.it/en/english-version/). In 2012 I've moves to St. Petersburg(Russia) in order to work in e-learning startup [dnevnik.ru](https://dnevnik.ru) as junior frontend developer. In 2013 I've started work at [Intermedia](https://www.intermedia.net) as UI developer.\r\nIn 2014 I got married to beautiful Irina, she is QA engineer, singer and [painter](http://nyellin.deviantart.com).\r\nAlso since 2012 I got interested in 3D printing and created have my own [3D printing studio](http://3dprint.spb.ru)\r\nMy field interests focused around:\r\n1.

Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
